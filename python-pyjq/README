IMPORTANT NOTE:

This package is forked from the author's original version on GitHub[1]
and will remain forked while I do some development on it.

Key changes so far:

 - Build extension with Cython from inside setup.py
 - Add/correct library search path behavior

Planned additions:

 - Throw an exception if the script raises an error.
