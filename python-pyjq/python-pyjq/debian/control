Description: Python bindings for jq
 jq is like sed for JSON data â€“ you can use it to slice and filter and map and
 transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends
 let you play with text.
 .
 You can seamlessly call jq script (like regular expression) and process plain
 python data structure.
