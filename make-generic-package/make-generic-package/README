Generic Makefile for RPM and Debian packages

This includable Makefile automatically builds packages for Red Hat-
and Debian-derived systems.

To use this file, create a Makefile containing the following:

    inclulde make/generic-package.make

Targets (Shortcuts in Parentheses):

 * build (b) - Build the package.  This is the default target.
 * install (i) - Install the package forcibly.  Must be run as a user
                 that can do this.
 * dump (d) - Dump contents of built packages.
 * clean (c) - Remove build by-products.

Other useful shortcut targets:

    cb - Clean and build
    cbd - Clean, build and dump
    cbi - Clean, build and install
    cbic - Clean, build and install and forced re-clean
    cbdc - Clean, build, dump and forced re-clean


To construct a tarball of your sources automatically:

  - Name a subdirectory with the name of the product (e.g, foomatic)
  - Specify a tarball in the source (e.g., Source0: foomatic-1.3.tar.gz)
  - Set AUTO_TARBALL=1 in your makefile

  NOTE:  The version number in the spec may not contain hyphens.
