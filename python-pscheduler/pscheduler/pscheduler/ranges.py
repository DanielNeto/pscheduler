def coalesce_ranges(ranges, duration):
    """
    Find the earliest mutually-agreeable time from lists provided by
    participants.

    The 'ranges' argument is a list of ranges is an array, with one
    element for each participant.  Each of those elements is a sorted
    list of tuples representing available time ranges.  Each tuple is
    (lower-time, upper-time).  Note that these ranges are treated as
    half-closed intervals of [lower, upper).

    The 'duration' argument is the minimum length a set of times found
    to be common must be to qualify.  Note that because the ranges are
    half-closed, [1, 2) matches a duration of 1, not 2.

    Return value is a tuple of (lower-time, upper-time) if there was a
    mutually-agreeable range found, None otherwise.

    NOTES:

    This function makes no attempt to make sure the ranges
    are lower-upper, so the GIGO principle applies.

    This function was written to be used with ranges of datetimes but
    will work with anything that can be compared for sorting.
