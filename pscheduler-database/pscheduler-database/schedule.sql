-- Functions that manage the schedule of runs
--


-- Gaps between scheduled time ranges.  This view does not
-- self-order.

-- Note that because PostgreSQL does not yet support infinite
-- intervals (been in the plans since before 2008, apparently), the
-- dates used for infinity are the minimum/maximum dates supported by
-- the TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE type.  Use of infinity would be more
-- elegant, but for this application, the dates will do fine.
--
-- See:
--   https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo#Dates_and_Times
--   http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype-datetime.html

-- TODO: In testing, the query plan for this did a lot of sequential
-- scans.  See if it uses the indexes when there are a larger number
-- of records.
